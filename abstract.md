Abstract
This project proposes the development of a smart mobile application integrated with an IoT-based soil monitoring system to assist farmers and plant owners in maintaining optimal plant health. The system consists of a microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) connected to soil sensors capable of measuring key parameters such as moisture, nutrient concentration (NPK), and pH levels. Data collected from the sensors will be transmitted to a mobile application where users can select the plant type they are growing.
The mobile app will compare real-time soil readings with predefined optimal ranges for the selected plant. The results will be presented in a clear, two-column format: the left side displaying the ideal values required by the plant, and the right side showing the current soil condition. Beneath this comparison, the application will generate actionable suggestions. For example, if nutrient levels are below the threshold, the app will recommend the type of fertilizer to use, the required quantity, and proper usage instructions. Similarly, it may suggest watering strategies or soil treatment methods to restore balance.
The system can further be enhanced with features such as data history visualization, automated irrigation control, integration with weather forecasts, and personalized recommendations for multiple plant species. This will create a comprehensive digital assistant for precision agriculture, reducing manual guesswork and improving yield.
For the prototype phase, the focus will be on implementing the core functionality: using an ESP32 microcontroller with a soil moisture sensor to measure water content, transmitting the values to a mobile app, and displaying them alongside predefined optimal values for selected plants. A simple rule-based recommendation engine will generate fertilizer or watering suggestions based on detected deviations.

Step 1: Define the Core Problem Clearly
•	You want farmers or plant owners to know if their plant’s soil is healthy.
•	You’ll measure soil parameters (moisture, nutrients, etc.).
•	Compare them to optimal values for that plant.
•	Then generate fertilizer/watering suggestions.

Step 2: Core Components
1.	Hardware (Sensors + Controller)
•	Microcontroller: Arduino / ESP32 (ESP32 is better since it has Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for mobile app connection).
•	Sensors:
•	Soil moisture sensor (water level).
•	Soil nutrient sensor (NPK sensor).
•	Soil pH sensor (optional but useful).
2.	Mobile App
•	Input: Select plant type.
•	Fetch sensor data (via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi).
•	Display: Side-by-side comparison (optimal vs. actual).
•	Generate suggestions (fertilizer, water, etc.).
3.	Knowledge Base
•	Database of optimal values per plant type (moisture range, nutrient range, pH).
•	Logic to compare and generate recommendations.

Step 3: What to Do First
Since this is a big project, start small:
✅ Phase 1 – Prototype Hardware
•	Buy an ESP32 + soil moisture sensor + maybe a basic NPK sensor.
•	Write a simple Arduino sketch to read sensor values and print them.
✅ Phase 2 – Mobile App Basic UI
•	Create a mock app (can even be in Figma at first).
•	Show a screen with:
•	Plant selection dropdown.
•	Two columns: Optimal values (static for now) vs. Current values (dummy numbers).
✅ Phase 3 – Communication
•	Make ESP32 send sensor values to the app (Bluetooth first, then Wi-Fi if needed).
✅ Phase 4 – Suggestion Logic
•	Hardcode rules first:
•	Example: “If nitrogen < required → Suggest fertilizer type X with Y grams”.
•	Later: Store rules in a database and make it dynamic.
